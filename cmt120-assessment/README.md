# Assessment 1

## How to start

If you can read this file, it means that you successfully decompressed the zip file attached to the assessment.

Inside the folder, you can find a number of files but, more importantly, two folders: `js` and `python`. These two folders contain the files you need to complete the assessment and test your code.

## Writing your code

Inside the folders `js` and `python` you can find a number of files:

* `template.py` and `template.js`. These files provide the functions' prototypes for the exercises of the assessment. You need to complete the code inside of each of the functions, following the instructions given in the exercises. Make sure that the type of variable returned is correct.
* `test_template.py` and `test_template.js`. These files contain the test cases that you can use to verify if your code works as intended. Feel free to add your own test cases to further test your code. However, no instructions are provided on how to do so.

## Testing your code

### Python
* To test your code, you need to have a working python distribution with `pipenv` installed.
* Run `pipenv install` from the project folder (the current folder) to install `pytest`.
* Execute `pytest` to run all the tests.
* Review the output to verify which tests have been passed and which have been failed.

### JavaScript
* To test your code, you need to have `node` installed.
* Run `npm install` from the project folder (the current folder) to install the testing libraries.
* Execute `npm run test-js` to run all the JS tests.
* Review the output to verify which tests have been passed and which have been failed.

## Submitting your code

* Rename your template files as `[student number].py` and `[student number].js`. So, if your student number is c123456789, your files should be named: `c123456789.py` and `c123456789.js` respectively.
* Fill in the cover sheet that you can find at the following [link](https://docs.cs.cf.ac.uk/downloads/coursework/Coversheet.pdf).
* Compress the three files into a single zip file and submit it using Learning Central.
* Congratulation! You are done and you can enjoy a well-deserved rest.
